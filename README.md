# kleene

Generate a Kleene tree.

The work is done by `kleene.py`.

Plotting can be seen by running `animate.py` with Python 3. Change the first
line to `USE_CACHE = True` to use the cached results stored in `cuts.py`
instead of generating them live.

### Requirements

Plotting uses `matplotlib`, (which depends on `tkinter`).

Install using
```
pip3 install matplotlib --user
```

or
```
python3 -m pip install matplotlib --user
```
